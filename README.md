# spellRectify
A Python based project build on Flask framework.  This application suggests a list of corrections that match the given input word and also gives the most likely correction from that list of correction. It even splits the input word if the given word can be split into two or more meaningful words.  If the user wants to generate random words then there is a button for that as well!!
